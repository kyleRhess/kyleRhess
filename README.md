_A random quote_
___
***A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few
months–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would
have a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report that
certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other
workers, or more.
